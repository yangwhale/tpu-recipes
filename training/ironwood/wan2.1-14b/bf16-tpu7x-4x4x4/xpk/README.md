    to install Docker.
-   **Python 3.12 Virtual Environment:** A Python
    3.12 virtual environment is required. Instructions
    for setting this up are also in the
    [Install XPK and dependencies](#install-xpk-and-dependencies) section.
-   **XPK and Dependencies:** Follow the steps in the
    [Install XPK and dependencies](#install-xpk-and-dependencies) section to
    install XPK, `kubectl`, `kubectl-kueue`, and `kubectl-kjob`.


## Install XPK and dependencies

### XPK and Dependency Installation

#### Virtual Python Environment

Run the following to create a virtual Python environment:

```bash
# Set up uv
sudo apt update
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh -o install-uv.sh
chmod +x install-uv.sh
./install-uv.sh
rm install-uv.sh
source ${HOME}/.local/bin/env

# Set up and Activate Python 3.12 virtual environment
uv venv --seed ${HOME}/.local/bin/venv --python 3.12 --clear
source ${HOME}/.local/bin/venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
```

#### XPK

Make sure you have the virtual environment activated when running XPK.

Install XPK and necessary tools:

```bash
# Install gcloud, if not already installed, https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install
# Install kubectl, if not already installed, https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-access-for-kubectl#install_kubectl

# Ensure to log in to your gcloud

# Install latest xpk
pip install xpk==0.16.1

# Install xpk pre-reqs kubectl-kueue and kjob (if you installed xpk via pip)
curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AI-Hypercomputer/xpk/refs/tags/v0.16.1/tools/install-xpk.sh -o install-xpk.sh
chmod +x install-xpk.sh
sudo ./install-xpk.sh
rm install-xpk.sh

# Follow https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-access-for-kubectl#install_plugin to install gke-gcloud-auth-plugin
```

#### Docker

Install Docker using instructions provided by your administrator. Once
installed, run the following commands:

```bash
## Configure docker and test installation
gcloud auth configure-docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER ## relaunch the terminal and make sure you have the virtual environment activated after running this command
docker run hello-world # Test docker
```


## Orchestration and deployment tools

For this recipe, the following setup is used:

-   **Orchestration** -
    [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)
-   **Pretraining job configuration and deployment** - XPK is used to configure
    and deploy the
    [Kubernetes Jobset](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/03/23/introducing-jobset)
    resource, which manages the execution of the wan workload.


## Test environment

<!-- disableFinding(LINK_ID) -->

This recipe is optimized for and tested with tpu7x-4x4x4.

-   **GKE cluster** To create your GKE cluster, use the XPK instructions.
    [XPK instructions](https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/xpk?tab=readme-ov-file#cluster-create).
    A sample command to create an XPK cluster is provided below.

### Environment Variables for Cluster Creation

The environment variables required for cluster creation and workload execution
are defined at the beginning of the `run_recipe.sh` script. **Before running the
`xpk workload create` command**, please open `run_recipe.sh` and modify the
`export` statements to set these variables to match your environment. It is
crucial to use consistent values for `PROJECT_ID`, `CLUSTER_NAME`, and `ZONE`
across all commands and configurations.

-   `PROJECT_ID`: Your GCP project name.
-   `CLUSTER_NAME`: The target cluster name.
-   `ZONE`: The zone for your cluster (e.g., `us-central1-c`).
-   `CONTAINER_REGISTRY`: The container registry to use (e.g., `gcr.io`).
-   `BASE_OUTPUT_DIR`: Output directory for model training (e.g.,
    `"gs://<your_gcs_bucket>"`).
-   `WORKLOAD_IMAGE`: The Docker image for the workload. This is set in
    `run_recipe.sh` to
    `${CONTAINER_REGISTRY}/${PROJECT_ID}/${USER}-wan-runner` by
    default, matching the image built in the
    [Docker container image](#docker-container-image) section.
-   `WORKLOAD_NAME`: A unique name for your workload. This is set in
    `run_recipe.sh` to `${USER}-wan-$(date +%H%M)` by default.
-   `GKE_VERSION`: The GKE version, `1.34.0-gke.2201000` or later.
-   `ACCELERATOR_TYPE`: The TPU type (e.g., `tpu7x-4x4x4`). See topologies
    [here](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/plan-tpus#configuration).
-   `RESERVATION_NAME`: Your TPU reservation name. Use the reservation name if
    within the same project. For a shared project, use
    `"projects/<project_number>/reservations/<reservation_name>"`.

If you don't have a GCS bucket, create one with this command:

```bash
# Make sure BASE_OUTPUT_DIR is set in run_recipe.sh before running this.
gcloud storage buckets create ${BASE_OUTPUT_DIR} --project=${PROJECT_ID} --location=US  --default-storage-class=STANDARD --uniform-bucket-level-access
```

### Sample XPK Cluster Creation Command

```bash
xpk cluster create \
  --cluster=${CLUSTER_NAME} \
  --project=${PROJECT_ID} \
  --zone=${ZONE} \
  --tpu-type=${ACCELERATOR_TYPE} \
  --num-slices=1 \
  --reservation=${RESERVATION_NAME}
```


## Docker container image

To build your own image, follow the steps linked in this section. If you don't
have Docker installed on your workstation, see the section below for installing
XPK and its dependencies. Docker installation is part of this process.

### Steps for building workload image

The following software versions are used:

-   Python: 3.12
-   XPK: 0.16.1

Docker Image Building Command:

```bash
# Check if USER is set correctly
export CLOUD_IMAGE_NAME="${USER}-maxdiffusion-runner"
export WORKLOAD_IMAGE="gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/${CLOUD_IMAGE_NAME}"
gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID

# Set up and Activate Python 3.12 virtual environment for Docker build
uv venv --seed ~/.local/bin/venv-docker --python 3.12 --clear
source ~/.local/bin/venv-docker/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip

# Make sure you're running on a Virtual Environment with python 3.12
[[ "$(python3 -c 'import sys; print(f"{sys.version_info.major}.{sys.version_info.minor}")' 2>/dev/null)" == "3.12" ]] || { >&2 echo "Error: Python version must be 3.12."; false; }

# Change to your home directory and clone maxdiffusion
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxdiffusion.git
cd maxdiffusion
git checkout v3

# Run WAN 2.1 Docker build
export RECIPE_DOCKER_IMAGE=maxdiffusion_base_image
bash docker_build_dependency_image.sh mode=nightly
bash docker_upload_runner.sh CLOUD_IMAGE_NAME=${CLOUD_IMAGE_NAME}

# Deactivate the virtual environment
deactivate
```

## Training dataset

Before training, prepare the video training dataset. For this example, we will
be using the PusaV1 dataset.

```bash
# Set to TPU or CPU based on your local setup
# bash setup.sh MODE=stable DEVICE=cpu
bash setup.sh MODE=stable DEVICE=tpu
source ${HOME}/.local/bin/venv/bin/activate

# Following assumes that you have mounted an external drive to your VM
# and you have created a mount point for `/mnt/disks/external_disk`
# along with given write permissions to the directories described below.
export HF_TOKEN=<token>
export HF_DATASET_DIR=/mnt/disks/external_disk/PusaV1_training/
export TFRECORDS_DATASET_DIR=/mnt/disks/external_disk/wan_tfr_dataset_pusa_v1
export HF_HUB_CACHE=/mnt/disks/external_disk/maxdiffusion_hf_cache/
export DATASET_DIR=${BASE_OUTPUT_DIR}/PusaV1_training

# Download the dataset
huggingface-cli download RaphaelLiu/PusaV1_training --repo-type dataset --local-dir ${HF_DATASET_DIR}

# Preprocess and convert the dataset to TFRecord format
# This can be done outside of XPK, or a TPU machine. We recommend using a CPU machine for this preprocessing step. Use skip_jax_distributed_system=True when running on cpu machine.
python src/maxdiffusion/data_preprocessing/wan_pusav1_to_tfrecords.py src/maxdiffusion/configs/base_wan_14b.yml train_data_dir=${HF_DATASET_DIR} tfrecords_dir=${TFRECORDS_DATASET_DIR} no_records_per_shard=10 skip_jax_distributed_system=True

# Upload to gcs
gcloud storage cp --recursive ${TFRECORDS_DATASET_DIR} ${DATASET_DIR}
```

## Run the recipe

### Configure environment settings

Before running any commands in this section, ensure you have set the environment
variables as described in
[Environment Variables for Cluster Creation](#environment-variables-for-cluster-creation).

### Connect to an existing cluster (Optional)

If you want to connect to your GKE cluster to see its current state before
running the benchmark, you can use the following gcloud command. (Note that XPK
does this for you already):

```bash
gcloud container clusters get-credentials ${CLUSTER_NAME} --project ${PROJECT_ID} --zone ${ZONE}
```

## Get the recipe
```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/ai-hypercomputer/tpu-recipes.git
cd tpu-recipes/training/ironwood/wan2.1-14b/bf16-tpu7x-4x4x4/xpk
```

### Run wan Pretraining Workload

The `run_recipe.sh` script contains all the necessary environment variables and
configurations to launch the wan pretraining workload.

Before execution, use `nano ./run_recipe.sh` to edit the script and configure the environment variables to match your specific environment.

To configure and run the benchmark:

```bash
chmod +x run_recipe.sh
nano ./run_recipe.sh
./run_recipe.sh
```

You can customize the run by modifying `run_recipe.sh`:

-   **Environment Variables:** Variables like `PROJECT_ID`, `CLUSTER_NAME`,
    `ZONE`, `WORKLOAD_NAME`, `WORKLOAD_IMAGE`, and `BASE_OUTPUT_DIR` are defined
    at the beginning of the script. Adjust these to match your environment.
-   **MaxDiffusion Workload Overrides:** The `MAXDIFFUSION_ARGS` variable holds
    the arguments passed to the training command. This includes model-specific
    settings.

Note that any MaxDiffusion configurations not explicitly overridden in
`MAXDIFFUSION_ARGS` are expected to use the defaults within the specified
`WORKLOAD_IMAGE`.

## Monitor the job

To monitor your job's progress, you can use kubectl to check the Jobset status
and stream logs:

```bash
kubectl get jobset -n default ${WORKLOAD_NAME}

# List pods to find the specific name (e.g., deepseek3-0-0-xxxx)
kubectl get pods | grep ${WORKLOAD_NAME}
```
Then, stream the logs from the running pod (replace <POD_NAME> with the name you found):

```bash
kubectl logs -f <POD_NAME>
```
You can also monitor your cluster and TPU usage through the Google Cloud
Console.

### Follow Workload and View Metrics

After running `xpk workload create`, you will get a link to the Google Cloud
Console to view your workload logs. Example: `[XPK] Follow your workload here:
https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/service/${ZONE}/${PROJECT_ID}/default/<workload_name>/details?project=${PROJECT_ID}`
Alternatively, list workloads: (`xpk workload list`)

```bash
xpk workload list --cluster ${CLUSTER_NAME} --project ${PROJECT_ID} --zone ${ZONE}
```

For more in-depth debugging, use xpk inspector: (`xpk inspector`)

```bash
xpk inspector --cluster ${CLUSTER_NAME} --project ${PROJECT_ID} --zone ${ZONE} [--workload <workload_name>]
```


### Delete resources

#### Delete a specific workload

```bash
xpk workload delete --workload <workload_name> --cluster ${CLUSTER_NAME} --project ${PROJECT_ID} --zone ${ZONE}
# Or filter and delete:
xpk workload delete --cluster ${CLUSTER_NAME} --project ${PROJECT_ID} --zone ${ZONE} --filter-by-job=${USER}
```

#### Delete the entire XPK cluster

```bash
xpk cluster delete --cluster ${CLUSTER_NAME} --zone ${ZONE} --project ${PROJECT_ID}
```


## Check results

After the job completes, you can check the results by:

-   Accessing output logs from your job.
-   Checking any data stored in the Google Cloud Storage bucket specified by the
    `${BASE_OUTPUT_DIR}` variable in your `run_recipe.sh`.
-   Reviewing metrics in Cloud Monitoring, if configured.
