# Serve Llama3.x with vLLM on TPU VMs

In this guide, we show how to serve
[Llama3.1-8B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct), 
[Llama3.3-70B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct).

> **Note:** Access to Llama models on Hugging Face requires accepting the Community License Agreement and awaiting approval before you can download and serve them.

## Step 0: Install `gcloud CLI`

You can reproduce this experiment from your dev environment
(e.g. your laptop).
You need to install `gcloud` locally to complete this tutorial.

To install `gcloud CLI` please follow this guide:
[Install the gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install#mac)

Once it is installed, you can login to GCP from your terminal with this
command: `gcloud auth login`.

## Step 1: Create a v6e TPU instance

We create a single VM. For Llama3.1-8B, 1 chip is sufficient and for the 70B
models, at least 8 chips are required. If you need a different number of
chips, you can set a different value for `--topology` such as `1x1`,
`2x4`, etc.

To learn more about topologies: [v6e VM Types](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/v6e#vm-types).

> **Note:** Acquiring on-demand TPUs can be challenging due to high demand. We recommend using [Queued Resources](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/queued-resources) to ensure you get the required capacity.

### Option 1: Create an on-demand TPU VM

This command attempts to create a TPU VM immediately.

```bash
export TPU_NAME=your-tpu-name
export ZONE=your-tpu-zone
export PROJECT=your-tpu-project

# this command creates a tpu vm with 8 Trillium (v6e) chips - adjust it to suit your needs
gcloud alpha compute tpus tpu-vm create $TPU_NAME \
    --type v6e --topology 2x4 \
    --project $PROJECT --zone $ZONE --version v2-alpha-tpuv6e
```

### Option 2: Use Queued Resources (Recommended)

With Queued Resources, you submit a request for TPUs and it gets fulfilled
when capacity is available.

```bash
export TPU_NAME=your-tpu-name
export ZONE=your-tpu-zone
export PROJECT=your-tpu-project
export QR_ID=your-queued-resource-id # e.g. my-qr-request

# This command requests a v6e-8 (8 chips). Adjust accelerator-type for different sizes. For 1 chip (Llama3.1-8B), use --accelerator-type v6e-1.
gcloud alpha compute tpus queued-resources create $QR_ID \
    --node-id $TPU_NAME \
    --project $PROJECT --zone $ZONE \
    --accelerator-type v6e-8 \
    --runtime-version v2-alpha-tpuv6e
```

You can check the status of your request with:

```bash
gcloud alpha compute tpus queued-resources list --project $PROJECT --zone $ZONE
```

Once the state is `ACTIVE`, your TPU VM is ready and you can proceed to the next steps.

## Step 2: SSH to the instance

```bash
gcloud compute tpus tpu-vm ssh $TPU_NAME --project $PROJECT --zone=$ZONE
```

## Step 3: Use the latest vLLM Docker image for TPU

```bash
export DOCKER_URI=vllm/vllm-tpu:v0.12.0
```

The docker image is pinned here for users to reproduce the [results below](#section-benchmarking).

To use the latest stable version, set `DOCKER_URI=vllm/vllm-tpu:latest`.

To use the latest nightly built image that has more recent features/improvements, set `DOCKER_URI=vllm/vllm-tpu:nightly`.

## Step 4: Run the Docker container in the TPU instance

```bash
sudo docker run -it --rm --name $USER-vllm --privileged --net=host \
    -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm \
    --shm-size 150gb \
    --entrypoint /bin/bash ${DOCKER_URI}
```

> **Note:** 150GB should be sufficient for the 70B models. For the 8B model allocate at least 17GB for the weights.

> **Note:** See [this guide](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/attach-durable-block-storage) for attaching durable block storage to TPUs.

## Step 5: Set up env variables

Export your hugging face token along with other environment variables inside
the container.

```bash
export HF_HOME=/dev/shm
export HF_TOKEN=<your HF token>
```

## Step 6: Serve the model

Now we start the vllm server.
Make sure you keep this terminal open for the entire duration of this experiment.

Here is the serving command for the 70B model:

```bash
export MAX_MODEL_LEN=2048
export TP=8 # number of chips

vllm serve meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct \
    --seed 42 \
    --disable-log-requests \
    --no-enable-prefix-caching \
    --async-scheduling \
    --gpu-memory-utilization 0.98 \
    --max-num-batched-tokens 512 \
    --max-num-seqs 256 \
    --tensor-parallel-size $TP \
    --max-model-len $MAX_MODEL_LEN
```

| Model | Input/Output Scenario | max-num-batched-tokens | max-num-seqs | tensor-parallel-size |
|:--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Llama-3.x-70B-Instruct | Prefill Heavy | 2048 | 256 | 8 |
| Llama-3.x-70B-Instruct | Decode Heavy/ Balanced | 512 | 256 | 8 |
| Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct | Prefill Heavy | 1024 | 128 | 1 |

Note: In order to accurately reproduce our results use:
*   **Prefill Heavy:** Input/Output tokens = 1800/128
*   **Decode Heavy/Balanced:** Input/Output tokens = 1000/1000



It takes a few minutes depending on the model size to prepare the server.
Once you see the below snippet in the logs, it means that the server is ready
to serve requests or run benchmarks:

```bash
INFO:     Started server process [7]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

## Step 7: Prepare the test environment

Open a new terminal to test the server and run the benchmark (keep the previous terminal open).

First, we ssh into the TPU vm via the new terminal:

```bash
export TPU_NAME=your-tpu-name
export ZONE=your-tpu-zone
export PROJECT=your-tpu-project

gcloud compute tpus tpu-vm ssh $TPU_NAME --project $PROJECT --zone=$ZONE
```

## Step 8: Access the running container

```bash
sudo docker exec -it $USER-vllm bash
```

## Step 9: Test the server

Let's submit a test request to the server. This helps us to see if the server is launched properly and we can see legitimate response from the model.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/completions \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "model": "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct",
        "prompt": "I love the mornings, because ",
        "max_tokens": 200,
        "temperature": 0
    }'
```

## Step 10: Prepare the test image

You will need to install datasets as it's not available in the base vllm
image.

```bash
pip install datasets
```

## <a id="section-benchmarking"></a>Step 11: Run the benchmark

Finally, we are ready to run the benchmark:

```bash
export MAX_INPUT_LEN=1000
export MAX_OUTPUT_LEN=1000
export MAX_CONCURRENCY=128
export HF_TOKEN=<your HF token>

cd /workspace/vllm

vllm bench serve \
    --backend vllm \
    --model "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct"  \
    --dataset-name random \
    --ignore-eos \
    --num-prompts 3000 \
    --random-input-len=$MAX_INPUT_LEN \
    --random-output-len=$MAX_OUTPUT_LEN \
    --max-concurrency=$MAX_CONCURRENCY \
    --seed 100
```

The snippet below is what you’d expect to see - the numbers vary based on the vllm version, the model size and the TPU instance type/size.
